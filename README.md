## Installation

Please follow [the installation instructions on the website](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/get_it_now).

### Installing the source directly from git

If you mean to install the latest version of Passenger directly from this git repository, then you should run one of the following commands. Installing from the git repository is basically the same as the tarball installation method, as [described in the manual](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/), with one exception: you need to clone git submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

After that, run one of the following:

    ./bin/passenger-install-apache2-module

-OR-

    ./bin/passenger-install-nginx-module

-OR-

    # From your application directory
    ~/path-to-passenger/bin/passenger start

For troubleshooting, configuration and tips, please also refer to the above documentation. For further support, please refer to [the Phusion Passenger support page](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/support).

Ruby users can also build a gem from the Git repository and install the gem.

    gem build passenger.gemspec
    gem install passenger-x.x.x.gem
